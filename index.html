            <h2>About JUGGERNAUT</h2>
            <p>No one has ever seen the face hidden beneath the mask of Yurnero the Juggernaut. It is only speculation
                that
                he even has one. For defying a corrupt lord, Yurnero was exiled from the ancient Isle of Masks--a
                punishment
                that saved his life. The isle soon after vanished beneath the waves in a night of vengeful magic. He
                alone
                remains to carry on the Isle's long Juggernaut tradition, one of ritual and swordplay. The last
                practitioner
                of the art, Yurnero's confidence and courage are the result of endless practice; his inventive bladework
                proves that he has never stopped challenging himself. Still, his motives are as unreadable as his
                expression. For a hero who has lost everything twice over, he fights as if victory is a foregone
                conclusion.
